# Reveâ€™sPuzzle
There are eight disks of different sizes and four pegs. Initially, all the disks are on the first peg in order of size, the largest on the bottom and the smallest on the top. The objective is to transfer all the disks to another peg by a sequence of moves. Only one disk can be moved at a time, and it is forbidden to place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Devise an algorithm that solves the puzzle in 33 moves.
