Given an unsorted array compute the sum of each pair and count the repetition of the resulted sum

For example

Note that: to distinguish between the two 10s in this example, the underscore (10) is used to represent the 10 at index 3.

Write and implement an algorithm to solve this problem and compute its complexity
