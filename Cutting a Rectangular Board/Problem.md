# Cutting a Rectangular Board

There is an m × n rectangular board drawn on graph paper. You need to cut it into mn 1 × 1 squares by straight cuts along the grid lines. You are allowed to stack several pieces together to cut them at the same time, which is considered one cut. Design an algorithm that performs this task with the minimum number of cuts.
