# Odometer Puzzle 

A car odometer can display any six-digit combination from 000,000 to 999,999, inclusive. If it runs through its entire range, how many such combinations will have at least one digit 1 in them? What is the total number of times the digit 1 will be displayed? (For example, 101,111 contributes five toward the total count of 1â€™s, and the next reading of 101,112 adds four more.)
